        <h6 class="text-body vw-50">PICO-8 is a virtual machine and game engine created by Lexaloffle Games. It is a
          fantasy video
          game
          console that mimics the limited graphical and sound capabilities of 8-bit systems of the 1980s. The goal of
          this is to encourage creativity and ingenuity in producing games without being overwhelmed with the many
          possibilities of modern tools and machines. Such a design also allows PICO-8 games to have a familiar look and
          feel. Coding on the PICO-8 is accomplished through a Lua-based environment, in which users can create music,
          sound effects, sprites, maps, and games. Users are able to export their games as HTML5 web games or upload
          their creations to Lexaloffle's official BBS where other users are able to play the games in a web browser,
          and view the source code. PICO-8 games can also be exported as executable programs, which will run on Windows,
          macOS, or Linux. Notable games released for the system include the original version of Celeste, which was
          created in four days
          as part of a game jam.</h4>

        <h6 class="text-body vw-50">The Pico Pocket is a special device that can connect to wireless keyboards for lua
          based coding on the Pico-8 platform. For multiplayer games the pico pocket can make local connections to other
          near devices to allow multiplayer and screen display on other devices wirelessly. Pico pocket also has an easy
          access to Itch.io, the market place and sharing lobby for Pico developers. If you wanted to go retro, this is
          the best way to go with pico pocket.</h6>

          player your favorite games ranging from consoles from the Atari and the GBA to the xbox 360 and Playstation 2.
          The device also works as a mp3 and mp4 player for when the wifi goes out. The Pico Pocket is tied with Parsec
          software which allows players to play their favorite games online as if they were right next to them on the

              Examiner put together a report that surveyed over 2,500 marketers about their businesses' social media
              marketing efforts. With 83% of those surveyed placing a high value on social media, it is clear that
              social media marketing works. Being active on social media has the clear benefits of increasing inbound
              traffic, but once customers land on your site, how do you re-utilize your social media marketing efforts
              to increase conversions? This is where a social hub can come into play. Social hubs allow you to:

              Target your website audience with your social media marketing. Your website audience is the most likely to
              be the one purchasing or learning about your brand, and a social hub can bring the marketing effort put
              into social media back onto the website.
              Make the most of each post. A social hub allows a brand to re-utilize the content they post on each social
              network to the maximum benefit, to reach the users most interested in their brand (the ones landing
              directly on their website)
              Build trust. Brands that are active on social media are more trusted because their active presence
              indicates legitimacy. A social hub showcases this activity where it matters most.
              Increase engagement. By aggregating and showcasing social media content, a social hub can create more
              opportunities for a customer to interact with a brand, whether it be through a retweet, or a shared
              Facebook post.
              Increase sales. The cumulative effect of the above is to increase conversions and improve brand
              performance when it comes to sales.</h6>
